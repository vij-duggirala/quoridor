# quoridor
The project is a game titled as Quoridor and is based on a board-game of the same name.  The game Quoridor is a Mensa Award winning game and is well known for its simple rules but complicated gameplay.

It is a strategic game where each player well equipped with 10 or more walls tries to win the game by reaching to the opposite side of the board before his opponent does. In his turn he can either move his player or place a wall.

The program just tries to replicate this mindboggling board game on the digital platform in C++. The program assigns each player with a unique player code/id. Each playerâ€™s data is stored in the form of a structure in a binary file. It keeps a track of how many matches each player has participated in and how many he has won. It promptly displays the same before the start of every match.

The board consisting of a 9x9 table is set with the two players at the opposite sides of the boards starting at the centre of each row. Using simple commands users can manoeuvre their players and also place walls in their turn. The program validates each and every move made by both players resulting in a fun and fair game of battling wits. The game ends when one of them reaches to the other end and is declared the winner. At the end of each match, the program prints the number of moves and walls used by each player.
